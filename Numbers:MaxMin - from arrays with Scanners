 * Coding Problem: Write a code that asks the user how many numbers he/she wants in his/her list. Then ask for
 * the sufficient number of inputs that will fill all the spaces in the list. Next, output all the entered numbers.
 * Finally, output what are the largest and smallest numbers amongst all the entered numbers. Use iterations, scanners,
 * and make sure that your code looks aesthetically pleasing, with appropriate questions at appropriate times.
